<h2>Regex in JavaScript</h2>

<p>Regular expressions are used in programming languages to match strings. You create patterns to help you do that matching.</p>
<p>.test() method takes the regex and applies it to the string(which is placed inside the parantheses), and returns true or false if your pattern finds something or not.</p>
<p>You can extract matches with the .match() method. Apply the method on a string and pass in the regex inside the parantheses</p>
<p>You can search for multiple patters using the alternation or OR operator: |</p>
<p>To ignore case use the i flag /regexhere/i</p>
<p>To search or extract a pattern more than once, use the g flag.</p>
<p>The wildcard character . will match any one character. It is also called dot and period.</p>
<p>Character classes can be placed inside []. They allow you to define a group of characters you wish to match. Specify a range of characters using the hyphen - . Eg. /[a-z0-9]/ig;</p>
<p>Negated character sets. To create these, place a caret (^) after the opening bracket and before the characters you do not want to match.</p>
<p>Outside of a character set, the caret(^) is used to search for patterns at the beginning of strings and the dollar sign ($) at the end of the regex to search for patterns at the end of strings.</p>
<p>To match a character that occurs once or more in a row, use the plus (+) character. This means that it occurs atleast once and may be repeated. The character or pattern has to be present consecutively.</p>
<p>To match a character that occurs zero or more times, use the asterisk (*) character.</p>
<p>greedy match v/s lazy match. Regex are by default greedy. Use the character ? to change it to lazy matching.</p>
<p>Shorthand character classes: Use \w to match [A-Za-z0-9_]. This character class matches upper and lower case letters plus numbers and also includes the underscore character. To match everything but letters and numbers, use \W to match [^A-Za-z0-9_].
Shortcut to look for digit characters is \d which is equal to [0-9]. \D is equal to [^0-9]. Use shortcut \s to search for whitespace and \S to search for everything except whitespace.</p>
<p>Quantity specifiers: ({ }) You put two numbers between the curly brackets for the lower and upper number of patterns. These can be used with other shortcuts</p>
<h4>Common flags</h4>
<ul>
	<li>i : case insensitive</li>
	<li>g : global (doesn't stop after first match)</li>
	<li>m : multi-line</li>
</ul>
<h4>Common Anchors</h4>
<ul>
	<li>^ : start of string</li>
	<li>$ : end of string</li>
	<li></li>
</ul>
