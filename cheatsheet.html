<h2>Regex in JavaScript</h2>

<p>Regular expressions are used in programming languages to match strings. You create patterns to help you do that matching.</p>
<p><span>.test()</span> method takes the regex and applies it to the string(which is placed inside the parantheses), and returns true or false if your pattern finds something or not.</p>
<p>You can extract matches with the <span>.match()</span> method. Apply the method on a string and pass in the regex inside the parantheses</p>
<p>You can search for multiple patters using the <span>alternation or OR operator: |</span></p>
<p>To ignore case use the <span>i flag /regexhere/i</span></p>
<p>To search or extract a pattern more than once, use the <span>g flag</span>.</p>
<p>The <span>wildcard character .</span> will match any one character. It is also called dot and period.</p>
<p>Character classes can be placed inside <span>[]</span>. They allow you to define a group of characters you wish to match. Specify a range of characters using the <span>hyphen -</span>. Eg. /[a-z0-9]/ig;</p>
<p>Negated character sets. To create these, place a <span>caret (^)</span> after the opening bracket and before the characters you do not want to match.</p>
<p>Outside of a character set, the <span>caret(^)</span> is used to search for patterns at the beginning of strings and the <span>dollar sign ($)</span> at the end of the regex to search for patterns at the end of strings.</p>
<p>To match a character that occurs once or more in a row, use the <span>plus (+)</span> character. This means that it occurs atleast once and may be repeated. The character or pattern has to be present consecutively.</p>
<p>To match a character that occurs zero or more times, use the <span>asterisk (*)</span> character.</p>
<p>greedy match v/s lazy match. <span>Regex are by default greedy</span>. Use the character <span>?</span> to change it to lazy matching.</p>
<p>Shorthand character classes: Use <span>\w</span> to match [A-Za-z0-9_]. This character class matches upper and lower case letters plus numbers and also includes the underscore character. To match everything but letters and numbers, use <span>\W</span> to match [^A-Za-z0-9_].
Shortcut to look for digit characters is <span>\d</span> which is equal to [0-9]. <span>\D</span> is equal to [^0-9]. Use shortcut <span>\s</span> to search for whitespace and <span>\S</span> to search for everything except whitespace.</p>
<p><span>Quantity specifiers: ({ })</span> You put two numbers between the curly brackets for the lower and upper number of patterns. These can be used with other shortcuts</p>
<p>Lookaheads: (There are two kinds) <span>positive lookahead (?=...)</span> and <span>negative lookahead (?!...)</span></p>
<p>A <span>positive lookahead</span> will look to make sure the element in the search pattern is there, but wont actually match it. A <span>negative lookahead</span> will look to make sure the element in the search pattern is not there.</p>
<p>A more practical use of lookaheads is to check two or more patterns in one string.</p>
<p><span>Capture groups</span> uses parantheses <span>(</span> and <span>)</span> for searching repeat substrings. You put the regex of the pattern that will repeat in between the parentheses. To specify where that repeat string will appear, you use a backslash ( <span>\</span> ) and then a number. This number starts at 1 and increases with each additional capture group you use.</p>
<p>You can also use capture groups to search and replace using <span>.replace()</span></p>
